					<h2 style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  At the simplest level, a Cafe Mocha means either adding chocolate to your coffee, or adding a shot of espresso coffee to your hot chocolate. In the latter case, the best Cafe Mocha is not made with drip-brewed coffee but rather Italian-brewed espresso.</h2>
					<br>
						<br>
					<h2 style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There are many reasons why espresso is a better complement to chocolate than regular-brewed coffee. Espresso has more 'opposing' taste characteristics for a balanced but bold flavor. If you simply add chocolate to your coffee, there won't be as much flavor in the coffee that counters the chocolate and it will end up tasting like an 'off' mix of the two.</h2>
					<br>
						<br>
					<h2 style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Start boiling water. Grind your dark-roasted beans to a fine grind. Start the water heating cycle with your espresso machine, including enough water in the machine to run steam from the milk frother.</h2>
					<br>
						<br>
					<h2 style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Put the mocha powder in an oversized mug. When your water is boiling, pour it in the mug with the mocha powder. Stir until the powder is completely dissolved into a mocha syrup.</h2>
					<br>
						<br>
					<h2 style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; With your espresso machine frother, begin to heat the milk. You will be heating the milk rather than frothing it so if your espresso machine frother comes with a rubber spout that frothes the milk, remove that rubber spout. Once the milk is very hot, let the espresso brewing cycle complete.</h2>
					<br>
						<br>
					<h2 style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As soon as the espresso is ready, pour it into the mug with the mocha syrup. Top up the mug with the heated milk, leaving enough room for the whipped cream that you will add at the end. Stir together. Top off with whipped cream as desired, and lightly sprinkle the top with mocha powder.</h2>
					<br>
						<br>
					<h2 style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the Espresso Truffle that costs $5 at Starbucks. If you would like to use the same ingredients that Starbucks uses, never fear. They sell their Espresso Blend and Mocha Powder at most outlets.</h2>
