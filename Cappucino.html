				<h2>Step 1: Make espresso.</h2>
					<h5>Do it however you always do it. Maybe you have a cool Nespresso machine like me and George Clooney, or maybe you use a Bialetti Moka. If you donít have an espresso machine, the easiest thing to do is buy a cheap Moka (here in Italy you can find them for a few euro), and some ground illy coffee.</h5>
						
				<h2>Step 2: Heat up milk.</p>
					<h5>Heat up about half a cup of milk in the microwave or on a stove top until its really hot, but not quite boiling. I put mine in the microwave for one minute. If you can, itís best to use a fresh whole milk since it will make a creamier froth.</h5>
							
				<h2>Step 3: Whip milk into a thick froth with a whisk.</h2>
					<h5>Take a whisk between the palms of your hands, and whip the milk until you have a thick froth. Ideally you shouldnít see any big bubbles, so whip for a couple of minutes if you need to.</h5>
								
				<h2>Step 4: Swirl & Tap.</h2>
					<h5>Swirl the glass in a circle to condense the foam together, and tap it on the counter to pop the bigger bubbles. Repeat swirling and tapping a few times until the foam looks nice and creamy!</h5>

										
				<h2>Step 5: Pour</h2>	
					<h5>Imeddiatly after one last swirl, pour the milk into the espresso, shaking your wrist side to side a bit to help the foam come out before the rest of the milk. This way it will sit nicely on top of the espresso.
						<br>
							<br>
					Thats it! Obviously, a cappuccino made with a milk steamer has a much thicker froth, so any self-respecting cappuccino snob will wrinkle their nose at this. That being said, this froth is actually pretty much the same quality as what I get from the Nespresso Aeroccino frother that I have.
						<br>
							<br>
					The whisk method is a quick and easy substitute for desperate circumstances. The next time you find yourself with only a whisk and a spoon, and someone tells you to make a cappuccino or walk the plank, youíll thank me.</h5>
